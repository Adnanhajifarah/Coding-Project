1. Sum of Two Numbers
a. Write a program that stores the integers 50 and 100 in variables, and
stores the sum of these two in a variable named total. Output the total.

2. Sales Prediction
a. The East Coast sales division of a company generates 58 percent of total
sales. Based on that percentage, write a program that will predict how
much the East Coast division will generate if the company has $8.6 million
in sales this year.

3. Sales Tax
a. Write a program that will compute the total sales tax on a $95 purchase.
Assume the state sales tax is 4 percent, and the country sales tax is 2
percent. Print out the total amount of sales tax.

4. Restaurant Bill
a. Write a program that computes the tax and tip on a restaurant bill for a
patron with a $90 meal charge. The tax should be 8 percent of the meal
cost. The tip should be 20 percent of the total after adding the tax. Display
the meal cost, tax amount, tip amount, and total bill on the screen. (in that
order)

5. Average of Values
a. To get the average of a series of values, you add the values up then divide
the sum by the number of values. Write a program that stores the following
values in five different variables:
i. 28, 32, 37, 24, 34
and stores the result in a separate variable called sum. Then write another
variable called average that divides the sum variable by 5 to get the average.
Display the average to the screen.

6. Annual Pay
a. Suppose an employee gets paid every two weeks and earns $2,200 each
pay period. In a year, the employee gets paid 26 times. Write a program
that defines the following variables:
i. payAmount : The variable will hold the amount of pay the
employee earns each pay period. Initialize the variable with 2200.0
ii. payPeriods: This variable will hold the number of pay periods in a
year. Initialize the variable with 26.
iii. AnnualPay: This variable will hold the employee’s total annual pay,
which will be calculated.
This program should calculate the employee’s total annual pay by multiplying the
employee’s pay amount by the number of pay periods in a year and store the results in
the annualPay variable. Display the total annual pay to the screen.

7. Ocean Levels
a. A customer in a store is purchasing five items. The prices of the five items
are as follows:
i. Price of item 1: $15.95
ii. Price of item 2: $24.95
iii. Price of item 3: $6.95
iv. Price of item 4: $12.95
v. Price of item 5: $3.95
Write a program that holds the prices of the five items in five variables. Display
each item’s price, the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sale tax, and the total after tax.
Assume sale tax is 7% (note display the prices as 15.95, etc)
